# osint-tool

just a basic tool that uses good osint tools.

reason of making this was for easy installation and combining the tools together.

Requirements :

golang - https://go.dev/dl/

python - https://www.python.org/downloads/


current errors:

When using maigret you have to input twice. First input wtv and click enter then it will say no usernames found then go maigret again and the name you used before will work.

SAME WITH MOSINT ^^^
